    <h2>The MMO of Kilimanjaro</h2>
    <h3>About MMO of Kilimanjaro</h3>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <br>
    <p> This fictional and non-existent MMO called "MMO of Kilimanjaro" is a survival </p>
    <p> game. This survival game has a market, and this market is represented on this </p>
    <p> website. This market will contact a back-end AWS server to retrieve, add, and </p>
    <p> remove data to and from itself. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Works kind of the same way as doing the back-end through the Universities </p>
    <p> California servers with mySQL. Only, with AWS you don't have to code the back </p>
    <p> -end as AWS does all the coding for the database for you so that you can </p>
    <p> mainly focus on front-end coding and technologies. </p>
    <br>
    <p> What this market consists of is a bunch of items that carry the following </p>
    <p> information: An image, item name, item price, seller name, location of seller </p>
    <p> (in the game), quantity of items, taxes, and item description. </p>
    <br>
    <p> So, the table essentially looks like this: </p>
    <br>
    <table id="table">
      <tr>
          <th>Item Id</th>
          <th>Image</th>
          <th>Item Name</th>
          <th>Item Price</th>
          <th>Item Description</th>
          <th>Seller Name</th>
          <th>Location</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>0000000</td>
          <td>https://www.example.com/</td>
          <td>Sample</td>
          <td>19</td>
          <td>--------------------</td>
          <td>--------------------</td>
          <td>--------------------</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p> The image will just be a url or a pointer to an image in the image folder at </p>
    <p> img/image_name.XXX, the url can be shrunk down with https://tinyurl.com/ as </p>
    <p> the table has limited space. The other data such as taxes and quantity of </p>
    <p> items will be calculated in this front-end with javascript functionality. </p>
    <br>

    <h3>About the Creator</h3>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <br>
    <p> My name is Emanuel Dretcanu and I've been coding at BSU for about a few years </p>
    <p> now and the journey has been really great. There have been rough patches here </p>
    <p> and there but over all the schooling has been good for me and I have learned </p>
    <p> a lot about programming and using various programming tools and software. </p>
    <br>
    <p> This is my second to last semester here at BSU and I am both glad and relieved. </p>
    <p> It's been a long journey here at the university and to all who have read up </p>
    <p> until this point, I wish you all a great semester and hope to see you at my </p>
    <p> graduation next semester even if you yourself are not graduating. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Best regards, </p>
    <br>
    <p> Emanuel Dretcanu </p>
